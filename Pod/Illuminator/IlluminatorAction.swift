/**
    Illuminator Actions are discrete chunks of UI interaction that can be scripted into more sophisticated tests.
 
    Actions (part of screens, which are part of the app) don't contain state; they simply act, and either succeed or fail in doing so.  In the rare case where stateful information is required by an action, Illuminator provides the AbstractStateType (essentially, a generic) to contain and convey this information to subsequent actions.

    Actions can both read and write the test state object, or ignore it completely.  In the vast majority of cases, they will ignore it; the test writer should be able to supply nearly all expected values for the test to verify.  One notable exception would be functions that depend on a random seed -- the seed would be part of the test state.  Another would be a test of a stopwatch function, in which the timestamp of taapping the "start" button might be saved in order to properly verify the correctness of the elapsed time.

    Actions rely on a test state, whose type is generic -- specific to the application.  This state supplies information that might be relevant to the UI action (which is otherwise stateless).

    - they have a function that takes state (absctract type) and returns state, throws
    - they are created from blocks within the screen defintion -- they contain a ref to the screen
    - they need a reference to an IlluminatorTestCaseWrapper to be able to push/pop continueAfterFailure
