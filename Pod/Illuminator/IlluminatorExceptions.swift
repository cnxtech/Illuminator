    Shorthand for throwing an exception that includes file/line information
    
    Based on a trick found here, in which it is revealed that swift enum cases that have associated types are actually closures:

    - Parameters:
        - exception: An IlluminatorException case, without associated type
        - message: The string to pass to the error
        - file: The file in which the error was thrown
        - line: The line on which the error was thrown
